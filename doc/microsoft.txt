CA certificates and CRLs contain an extension that provides information
about the certificate and key index. The extension is defined in Wincrypt.h
as szOID_CERTSRV_CA_VERSION with a value of "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.1". The
extension data is a DWORD value (encoded as X509_INTEGER in the extension);
the low 16 bits are the certificate index, and the high 16 bits are the key
index.
The initial installation of a CA produces a certificate index of zero and a
key index of zero. Renewal of a CA certificate will cause the certificate
index to be incremented. If the key is reused in the renewal, the key index
will be the same as the previous key index. If the key is not reused, the
key index will match the new certificate index.
